## Fruits and Vegetables

### Goal

We want to build a service which will take a request.json and:

- Process the file and create two separate collections for Fruits and Vegetables
- Each collection has methods like add(), remove(), list();
- Units have to be stored as grams;
- As a bonus you might consider giving option to decide which units are returned (kilograms/grams);
- As a bonus you might consider how to implement search() method collections;

## Requirement
- [Symfony 6.3](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html)
- [PHP 8.1 or higher](https://www.php.net/releases/8.2/en.php)


## Installing
- Make sure to add your database in both .env/.env.test change {your_host}:{mongo_port}
