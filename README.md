## Fruits and Vegetables

### Goal

We want to build a service which will take a request.json and:

- Process the file and create two separate collections for Fruits and Vegetables
- Each collection has methods like add(), remove(), list();
- Units have to be stored as grams;
- As a bonus you might consider giving option to decide which units are returned (kilograms/grams);
- As a bonus you might consider how to implement search() method collections;
